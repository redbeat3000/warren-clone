## Reducing Balance Calculation

### Formula
```
Interest Rate: 1.5% per month
Monthly Interest = Current Balance × 0.015

Example:
Month 1: Balance = 50,000
         Interest = 50,000 × 0.015 = 750
         New Balance = 50,000 + 750 = 50,750

Month 2: Repayment = 5,000
         Balance = 50,750 - 5,000 = 45,750
         Interest = 45,750 × 0.015 = 686.25
         New Balance = 45,750 + 686.25 = 46,436.25
```

### Key Points
- Interest calculated on **reducing balance** (not original principal)
- Interest compounds monthly
- Each repayment reduces the balance
- Lower balance = lower interest next month

## Technical Implementation

### Component: LoanRepaymentsView.tsx

#### State Management
```typescript
const [loans, setLoans] = useState<Loan[]>([]);
const [selectedLoan, setSelectedLoan] = useState<Loan | null>(null);
const [repayments, setRepayments] = useState<LoanRepayment[]>([]);
const [schedule, setSchedule] = useState<RepaymentScheduleRow[]>([]);
```

#### Data Fetching
```typescript
// Fetch all loans
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('loans')
  .select('*, users!inner(first_name, last_name, member_no, full_name)')
  .in('status', ['active', 'fully_paid', 'overdue'])
  .order('issue_date', { ascending: true });

// Fetch repayments for specific loan
const { data: repaymentsData } = await supabase
  .from('loan_repayments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('loan_id', loan.id)
  .order('payment_date', { ascending: true });
```

#### Schedule Calculation
```typescript
const calculateRepaymentSchedule = (loan: Loan, repayments: LoanRepayment[]) => {
  const interestRate = 0.015; // 1.5% per month
  let currentBalance = loan.principal;
  
  // For each month from issue date to now
  for (let i = 0; i <= monthsElapsed; i++) {
    const monthlyInterest = currentBalance * interestRate;
    const repaymentAmount = repaymentsByMonth[monthKey] || 0;
    
    currentBalance = currentBalance + monthlyInterest - repaymentAmount;
    
    // Add row to schedule
    scheduleRows.push({
      date, openingBalance, loanIssued, 
      interestRate: monthlyInterest, 
      repayment: repaymentAmount, 
      loanBalance: currentBalance
    });
  }
};
```
